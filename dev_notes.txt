# Game display
--------------
* team color the champions and the ellipse
* highlight the selected hex
    * map display can convert pixel to hex
    * game display controls the highlights
* flag all villages and windmills


# Pathfinding
-------------
* Game objects (towns, windmills, etc.) should not be walkable unless they're a
destination hex
- configurable walking speed
- move one hex less to land in ZoC to attack
- region boundary stops movement


# Polish
--------
- delay for a beat before scrolling the map when mouse is near the edge
* don't scroll when the mouse is outside the window
- how should obstacles overlap with different terrain?
* use the multi-edge transitions where available
* proper edge transitions to the border tiles
* draw the champion facing to the left when moving in that direction
* hide the ellipse while the champion is moving
* screen flashes white briefly when first loading
* try to cap the framerate to save CPU


# Improving edge transitions
----------------------------
* water to desert looks bad
    * desert over water looks a lot better
* grass over everything
* snow over everything but grass
* desert over swamp and dirt
* swamp over dirt (debatable)
* everything over water
* grass > snow > desert > swamp > dirt > water
* C:\Program Files\Wesnoth\data\core\images\terrain\hills\regular-to-water looks good
for grass
    * dry-to-water for dirt?
* try C:\Program Files\Wesnoth\data\core\images\terrain\swamp\mud-long for
swamp-to-water
* C:\Program Files\Wesnoth\data\core\images\terrain\frozen\snow-to-water
* mark tiles when they're included in the same terrain transition so only one side
gets drawn
* multi-edge transition artwork
    * C:\Program Files\Wesnoth\data\core\images\terrain\grass\green-medium only has 1
    * C:\Program Files\Wesnoth\data\core\images\terrain\flat\dirt has up to 4
    * C:\Program Files\Wesnoth\data\core\images\terrain\sand\desert has up to 4
    * mud-long and mud-to-land only has 1
    * snow has 4, snow-to-water has 2
    * dry-to-water, regular-to-water both have 2
    * add to the edges sprite sheet, the 2s go in the second row, 3s in third etc.
        * starting direction in same order as first row
- draw multi-edge transitions for same terrain?


# Draw castles automatically
----------------------------
* castle walls relative to the center castle tile
* where to draw the wall images relative to its hex
- if a unit is inside the castle
    - lower its y-offset by 15, along with its ellipse
    - front walls need to be drawn at a higher ZOrder, but only if unit is inside
- option #2: higher ZOrder for castle walls, but even higher one for when a unit
is next to or in front of a castle
- option #3: lower ZOrder when a unit is inside or behind the castle


# Data-driven map objects
-------------------------
- text description
- list of allowed terrain
- images to match each terrain
- number per region
- flaggable?
* map display needs to return multiple objects per tile (to allow flags and creatures)


# Game state
------------
* status of every game-relevant object
- not every object needs a drawable entity (why?)
* some objects represented by multiple entities (champions and their ellipses)
- keep track of armies
- zone of control, one hex radius points to the army controlling it
    - ZoC is not walkable unless it's a destination hex
    - update all of them any time somebody moves
- remove objects after they've been picked up
    - move to the invalid hex instead of deleting it?


# Thoughts on Combat
--------------------
* every battle is auto-combat
- "color wheel": Flyer > Mounted > Melee > Ranged > Flyer
* prevent gang-ups, maybe limit to 2 attackers per creature?
* one retaliation per creature per round
* keep it simple at first
    * attack in descending speed order
    * attacker chooses target
    * no skips or waits
    * few attributes: damage range, hp, speed
- idea: Tactics phase before combat
    - two rows of creatures
    - mounted and melee can only attack from the front row to the front row
    - flyers can attack front row from either row
    - ranged can attack either row from either row
    - ranged must use 1/2 damage melee attack if no friendly creatures in front of it
    - champion skill affects who gets to place creatures last
    - note that new rules will affect balance between creatures
- other ideas
    - elemental resistances
    - damage types, armor types
    - spells
    - limited shots for ranged creatures
    - luck, morale
- additional traits
    - steadfast, unlimited retaliation
    - double strike
    - first strike
    - binding, lowers target speed to 0
    - trample (probably more interesting with Tactics idea)
    - regeneration
    - life drain
    - zombify


# Image management
------------------
* animations have a key, number of frames, timing
* static images just need a key
* both might have to be team colored (lazily?)
* manager class needs handle to the window to be able to make textures
* images have:
    * base surface
    * 1 base texture
    * N team colored textures
* is a static image just a 1x1 texture atlas?
* is a static image just an animation with no frame timing?
* one class to rule them all?
* is the manager class just a vector of images?


# Entity system
---------------
* Drawable entities need:
    * partial pixel offset, initially assume drawn centered on the base hex
    * base hex
    * z-order (accents/flags, objects, hex shadow, hex highlight, projectiles, animating creature)
    * visible flag
    * texture or texture atlas + row/col
* keep the texture outside the entity struct so it's small and copyable
* store a variant texture/textureAtlas somewhere else?
* combine texture and textureAtlas into one class?
* pass entity updates by value, move-assign
* On each frame:
    * skip if not shown
    * convert base hex to pixel, compute the draw target
    * get bounding rect, determine whether within screen bounds


# Map viewer
------------
* read map json file from disk
* choose randomly between the three images for each tile
* map scrolling
* select obstacle images
* draw obstacles
* edge transitions
    * grass overlaps everything else
    * snow overlaps dirt, desert, water, swamp (overlapped by grass)
    * swamp overlaps dirt and desert (overlapped by grass, snow, water)
    * water overlaps swamp and desert (overlapped by grass, dirt, snow)
    * dirt overlaps water (overlapped by grass, desert, snow, swamp)
    * desert overlaps dirt (overlapped by grass, water, snow, swamp)
* map border
* draw dashed line between regions of same terrain
* need to draw dotted line between grass regions
* Window needs to report its own boundary
* pick one village image per terrain
- placeholder art for villages and castles


# Random Map
------------
* voronoi algorithm
* write JSON file
    * requires a build system so I can link JSON lib
* build region neighbor graph
    * flat vector of pairs?
    * build the whole thing for each hex?
* assign terrain by altitude
	* start with random region at altitude 0
	* randomly +1, 0, -1 for each neighbor
	* altitude 0: water, desert, swamp
	* altitude 1-2: grass, dirt
	* altitude 3: dirt, snow
* simple noise to assign obstacles, choose random 1-3?
    * build noise library locally in build_dir
    * static link
    * c++ wrapper
* clear obstacles to ensure each region can reach at least one other region
* clear obstacles to ensure all open hexes in each region are reachable
	* requires pathfinding
	* hex neighbors that are within the same region
    * BFS to find all walkable hexes within a region
        * were any hexes not visited?
        * if yes, clear a path to nearest visited and walkable hex
        * repeat from the previous unvisited hex
* obstacle should just be a bool, MapDisplay should choose which image to use
    * refactor obstacle assignment
* randomly assign starting towns for 4 players
* store castle locations as Hex?


# Containers
------------
- compact queue
    - minimize memory (de-)allocations
    - use a vector, keep index to the current front, add to the back
    - pop() should return by value to avoid invalidating references on push()
    - if pop() makes the queue empty, start overwriting old elements
    - this one is probably just a fun experiment, std::queue is going to be fine
* flat multimap
    * sorted vector of nodes
    * insert, sort, then read-only
    * write a find() that returns a range so we can use range-for-loop
        * bonus points if this exposes values only, not pairs
* priority heap
    * use some of the ideas from compact queue here?


# Build system
--------------
* set up git repository
* looked at build2, alpha release
* looked at Boost.Build, confusing
* go back to cmake (annoying)?
* maintain my own Makefile, learned how to auto-generate dependencies
* how does Wesnoth build on Windows?
* connect to GitHub
* GitHub two-factor auth?  (probably not worth the effort)


# C++ features
--------------
- use concepts to eliminate static_asserts
